<h1> What is SASS?</h1>
<div class="italic">
Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself. Sass consists of two syntaxes. The original syntax, called "the indented syntax," uses a syntax similar to Haml.[4] It uses indentation to separate code blocks and newline characters to separate rules. The newer syntax, "SCSS" (Sassy CSS), uses block formatting like that of CSS. It uses braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to separate lines within a block. The indented syntax and SCSS files are traditionally given the extensions .sass and .scss, respectively.

<h2>Partials</h2>
You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass files. This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. A partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name it something like _partial.scss. The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are used with the @use rule.

Sass has 2 syntaxes available:
Sass itself (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) in.sass files
SCSS (Sassy CSS) in .scss files, which is something halfway between regular CSS and Sass
The difference between Sass and SCSS is quite subtle.
Remember that:
Sass is the name of the preprocessor
SCSS is easier to learn
all resources on the internet (like The Sass Way) mention Sass, not SCSS
all features are available for both syntaxes
everything in SCSS is available in Sass
